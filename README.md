Ongoing issues:
- When viewing site in mobile browser, desktop styles are applied despite css including media querires (@media (max-width: 1024px)) that work in the desktop browser 
- In the nav bar, both the larger screen (horizontal menu) and smaller screen (hamburger menu) styles are being applied when the window is resized to below 1024px.
